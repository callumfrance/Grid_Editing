Grid_Editing
------------

## What?
Making 'char' grids in code is boring and annoying. 
Dammit, I don't want to spend all this time writing out
quotations and commas, and formatting it nicely.


How good would it be if all you had to do was type out your
character grid into a text document, and it is converted into
a python/java variable for you?



Grids will go by the 'length' of characters in the first column,
and the number of 'rows' of characters.
