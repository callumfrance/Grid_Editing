Grid_Editing
------------

## What?
Grid editing allows the creation of simple grids from the console.
Starting from the top left and working its way right and then down
by default, a grid is entered one character cell at a time.
Alternatively, by using the arrow keys, you can change the cursors'
position in the 'grid' as the point in the grid to edit.

The grid should then be able to be exported as a code document.

The code should be able to read in a grid of characters and spit
out a code document featuring the grid.

# Why?
Making grids can be tedious and boring, and reading them can be
even more of a pain. This program allows for the seamless transition
of making, and then using grids.



Grids will go by the 'length' of characters in the first column,
and the number of 'rows' of characters.
